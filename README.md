## Description

This application would give a user the ability to track their daily workouts. The application give the user the option to choose whether the workout being logged is a cardio or resistance training type of workout. The input is saved to a database. If the user decides to stop the workout and continue at a later time, the application has a continue workout feature. The user simply chooses to continue their workout and the data will save to pre-existing workout data. The user can view their workout stats via various graphs that shows the day, duration, total weight lifted and distance. The user can then clear the data by simply starting a new workout session.

## Application

-Run application from [Fitness Tracker](https://shielded-harbor-74107.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

The user can use the application by simply navigating to the heroku link. From there the user is presented with the default index page that gives that option of starting a new workout or viewing workout stats. Once the user starts a new workout, any input will be saved to a mongo database. Once the user wants to view their workout stats, the application will access data from mongoDB and present the user with a clean and easy to understand set to graphs. If the user wants to continue the workout at a later time, the data will persist once the application is launched again. When the user is done with a workout set, they simply clear the data by starting a new workout.
